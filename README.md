# Hello! My name is Jacob.
### A little about me:
I was originally born in Florida, but currently reside in the Pacific Northwest. I am an cybersecurity professional. I hold a B.S in cybersecurity from Western Washington University (NSA CAE-D Certified) and have a range of interests in the industry.

I interned at Twilio in the summer of 2022, and worked as a operational resilience analyst. My work focused on control auditing, process workflow improvements, and secure software life cycle recommendations. Additionally, I have experience with PISCES as a network security analyst during my course work at WWU.

I am open for work and prefer both in person or remote work opportunities.
